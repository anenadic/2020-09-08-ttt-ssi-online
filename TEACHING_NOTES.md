- Lesson split: Aleks Day 1 morning, Day 2 morning, Steve Day 1 afternoon, Day 2 afternoon
- Suggested lessons we will skip and schedule rejig: learner profiles and Bloom's taxonomy, and putting Q&A session together with How we operate episode; workshop introductions can be put together with Putting it all together episode
- We will be using Etherpad: https://pad.carpentries.org/2020-09-08-ttt-ssi-online (just not sure about uploading pictures - people can maybe link to their Drives?) 
It will be a blank doc and we sill be pasting exercise text ourselves. People found Google doc template a bit confusing.
