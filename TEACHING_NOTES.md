- Feedback from last time Aleks taught: https://github.com/edcarp/2020-05-28-ttt-edinburgh/blob/gh-pages/FEEDBACK.md
- Lesson split: Aleks Day 1 morning, Day 2 morning, Steve Day 1 afternoon, Day 2 afternoon, a bit less time because of the longer breaks - modify teaching accordingly
- Suggested lessons we will skip and schedule re-jig: learner profiles and Bloom's taxonomy, and putting Q&A session together with How we operate episode; workshop introductions can be put together with Putting it all together episode
- We will be using Etherpad: https://pad.carpentries.org/2020-09-08-ttt-ssi-online (just not sure about uploading pictures - people can maybe link to their Drives?) 
It will be a blank doc and we will be pasting exercise text ourselves - need to make sure the text of the exercise is correct and suitable for online version of the workshop. People found Google doc template a bit confusing.
- Recording teaching on Day 1? Also make sure they do not attempt live coding teaching.
- Example of live coding teaching by me and Steve?
- Need a visible clock to time exercises - there is an option for breakout rooms to have a timer
- Add contact details and links to mailing lists etc in How we operate
- Test Zoom with Steve: https://zoom.us/j/94200126664, the non-teaching instructor will have to be Zoom facilitator - muting people, assigning co-host provileges and managing breakout rooms, also pasting notes in the chat and Etherpad and monitor chat.
- Aleks to compile a list of useful links
- Aleks to create Google folder with slides
- Pictures in Etherpad - really need them!!!




## Notes from the day
- Invite questions more, e.g. when summauring an episode
- Less concept maps, more faded examples
- More feedback on exersises and work they do
- This is a useful program for checking how slides/figures appear for those who are cooler vision-impaired:  https://colororacle.org/
- prepraquisite shouyld be that learners attend a Carpentry workshop as a learber/helper/instructor
- start with a live codin session - this is where we are heading and where you will be at the end of the course
