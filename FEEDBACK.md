## What went well? What did you learn and you are excited to use in your next workshop?
- enjoyed learning about concepts map, and will play with them more ***
- Concept maps as a means to developing material *
- excellent time-keeping, great to have a clear schedule*
- Faded examples +1+1+1+1+1*
- I really liked the notion of "cognitive load". I've seen this applied a lot in terms of human factors and how people work during times of crisis, but I had never considered how it could be used in education. Super interesting, thank you.+1+1
- I like the etherpad dynamic to gather feedback, can this be used in our courses?**
- Quite a few interesting and new (at least for me) concepts: concept maps + cognitive load + chunking, etc. *
- I enjoyed learning about general learning mechanisms and concepts, and faded examples was a great example
- good to get that understanding of how limited short term memory is!+1 +1 interesting exercise for it too!
- I think eventually I'll find concept maps useful, but I need to go and think about them some more! I think I now know how carpentry participants feel! A lot of the stuff we're taught feels pretty abstract and I'm not sure when it will be useful, but I'm sure it will be eventually (the worry is, that by time I do need it, I'll have forgotten some of the important parts!)
- mind maps/mental models - great way to understand what the learner understands
- Good to think about targeting experience level of learners
- I liked the part about making multiple-choice questions diagnostic, it seems much better than less-thoughtful approaches -agreed! And another +1
- Nice to understand relation between mental models and concept maps
(maybe I misunderstood - I didn't see what the difference between a mental model and a concept map was :/ )
- mental model is in your mind -- concept map is a visualisation of the mental model (usually incomplete) which you can share with others or keep for yourself.
hmm... I obviously need to go and google this again :)
- Good to know how to use MCQ more effectively
- Concept maps & Mental Models, understanding how people learn a topic
- Remembering to teach the novice, not assume understanding
- Good pace
- I liked the use of breakout rooms for exercises, easier to share ideas in a small group

## What can be improved? What was confusing? Needs more explanation?
- more clarity on what to do in break out rooms, e.g. if we have 15 minutes, is it 5 minutes to do work and 10 mins to discuss or the other way around?
- concept map part seemed disjointed, visiting it early on then returning to it without much explaination to the difference+1+1
- More clarity on breakout rooms, and perhaps larger rooms (only two of us in the last one).
- I think more of a balance between concept maps and the diagnostic multiple-choice questions would be good. Right now it is heavily skewed towards concept maps. I, personally, don't find concept maps very useful because they don't fit the way I think, and would have liked more discussion around designing questions to guage understanding. I can empathise with that, I think the examples I came up on the spot were very contrived and didn't really help me practice what they're really for (that may be exacerbating the issue, but I have disliked concept maps for as long as I have known of them)
- Take a litte more time to revisit people responses.*
- maybe a bit more time to look at faded examples would have been nice
- Felt quite one-way (even though we were invited to interrupt), but I think that's a facet of online teaching
- Pre-allocate bullet points in this etherpad+1
- Time to complete excercises could be checked with participants (no zoom clock).
- More time to discuss exercise responses, get feedback, etc.
- Zoom clock was invisible for me, need manual reminders of time for exercises (looks like Zoom on Linux does not support this?)
- more on me than the instructors, but I'm not creative enough to come up with MCQs on the spot
